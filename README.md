# Get Sunrise By IP app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Design Choices

The MVP of this project took about 3 hours to complete. The full app including styles, refactoring, and writeups took about 6 hours.

After some experimentation I decided to use the [React Query Module] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-query) to complete the project. React Query makes interdependent API calls with stateful logic extreemly simple. Writing manual fetch logic for interdependent calls can be time consuming and error prone. I try to use the best tools available when approaching a given task.

The majority of the code for evaluation is in `src/App.js`

To use the app, simply type a valid ip address into the input bar.

then `cd sunrise-by-ip`

then `npm install`

finally `npm start`
