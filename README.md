# Get Sunrise By IP app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Design Choices

The MVP of this project took about 3 hours to complete. The full app including styles, refactoring, and writeups took about 6 hours.

After some exerimentation I decided to use the [React Query Module] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-query) to complete the project. React Querey makes interdependent API calls with stateful logic extreemly simple. Writing manual fetch logic for interdependent calls can be time consuming and error prone. I try to use the best tools available when approaching a given task.

## Running the app

in a new folder run `git clone https://github.com/ScottHouser/sunrise-by-ip.git`

then `cd sunrise-by-ip`

then `npm install`

finally `npm start`

to run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
